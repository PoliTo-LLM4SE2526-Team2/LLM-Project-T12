Both events meet DIRECT causation criteria:  \n  1. Both occurred before impeachment (Jan6 vs Jan13).  \n  2. Storming (A) was the proximate cause, while Trump’s address (C) was the root cause cited in impeachment articles.  \n  3. Neither is a consequence/correlation—they form the causal chain for impeachment.  \n\n**Critical Rules Followed**:  \n- Avoided over-selection by ensuring both A and C have explicit documentary evidence of direct causation.  \n- Rejected B (post-event consequence) and D (procedural response, not cause).  \n\n**Final Answer**: A, C\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: C\n",
