Lockdowns (a pandemic response) directly disrupted agricultural supply chains, aligning with the target event. Temporal and causal relationships are clear.  \n- **Option D**: While COVID-19 triggered financial-market meltdowns (Doc5), this is a parallel consequence, not the direct cause of agricultural obstruction specified in the target event.  \n- **Options B/C**: No evidence links clinical trials (C) to agricultural impacts. B is invalid as A is correct.  \n\nConclusion: Only **A** meets criteria for causation.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A\n",

Temporal & causal link confirmed.  \n- **B (Referendum date set in February):** Doc10 explicitly states the referendum date was set in February 2016. Temporal (precedes vote) and causal (enabled referendum).  \n- **D (Conservative Party won election):** Doc10 links Conservative victory (2015) to Cameron’s referendum pledge. Temporal (precedes referendum) and causal (enabled referendum process).  \n\n**Excluded:**  \n- **C (NI/Scotland voted remain):** Docs1/2 confirm regional votes, but these are consequences of the referendum result, not causes of Cameron’s resignation.  \n\n**Scoring Alignment:**  \n- Precision prioritized to avoid catastrophic errors.

This directly impaired medical response, contributing to fatalities. Temporal alignment (post-earthquake, pre-April 3) and causal mechanism (lack of care → higher death toll) confirm validity.  \n- **Option B**: While Doc3 notes emergency declarations, this is a reactive measure, not a causal driver of the death toll. Declarations aim to mitigate harm but do not inherently explain the high fatalities.  \n- **Option C**: Explicitly supported by Docs2 and Doc3 (earthquake damage, collapsed infrastructure, displacement). Directly caused fatalities and injuries via physical destruction.  \n- **Option D**: UN mobilization (Doc1) is a response effort, not a cause of the death toll. While aid challenges are noted, the mobilization itself does not explain the fatalities.  \n\n**Conclusion**: A (hospital collapse) and C (earthquake destruction) are direct, document-supported causes. B and D are responses or contextual factors, not causal drivers.  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A,C\n",

The certification resumed after law enforcement secured the Capitol, but the timeline shows Trump’s address preceded and triggered the chain of events.  \n- **Options A, C, D** are rejected:  \n  - A (woman shot) and D (five deaths) are consequences of the riots, not causes of certification.  \n  - C (FBI/ATF cleared Capitol) lacks explicit evidence (documents reference Capitol Police/National Guard).  \n  - D’s death toll (4 vs. 5) is factually incorrect.  \n\n**Risk-Adjusted Selection:**  \n- B has strong evidence and temporal precedence (speech → riot → delayed certification → eventual confirmation).

The tariffs created market turmoil and macroeconomic uncertainty explicitly cited in Doc6 as causing \"softness in bookings\" and reduced consumer/corporate confidence. This satisfies temporal order and causal mechanism (tariffs → economic uncertainty → demand decline). No evidence supports B/D.

The Conservatives’ victory directly enabled the referendum to proceed. Temporal order (election → referendum) and causal mechanism (pledge fulfillment) are clear.  \n\n- **Option C (Cameron pledged referendum in 2013):**  \n  Explicitly stated in Doc7: Cameron’s 2013 pledge created the referendum commitment. The referendum would not have occurred without this pledge. Temporal (2013 pledge → 2016 referendum) and causal linkage are unambiguous.  \n\n- **Option A (Failed renegotiation):**  \n  While Doc7 notes Cameron’s renegotiation efforts failed, this influenced the *content* of the referendum debate (leave vs. remain) but did not cause the referendum itself. The referendum was already scheduled due to B and C, regardless of renegotiation outcomes.  \n\n- **Option D (Nation divided):**  \n  Described in Doc1/Doc7 as a *consequence* of the referendum campaign, not a cause. Division emerged after the referendum was announced.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly **B** and **C** satisfy temporal precedence, causal direction, and documentary evidence.
