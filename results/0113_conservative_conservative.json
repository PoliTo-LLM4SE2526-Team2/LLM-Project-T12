The referendum’s occurrence is a prerequisite for regional voting outcomes.  \n\n2. **Option B (Prime Minister David Cameron pledged a referendum in 2013):**  \n   - **Direct Evidence**: Doc4 notes Cameron’s 2013 pledge to hold a referendum if his party won the election. Doc2 corroborates this timeline.  \n   - **Confidence**: 🟢 HIGH. The pledge directly led to the referendum, enabling Scotland and Northern Ireland’s votes.  \n\n3. **Option D (The UK voted to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum):**  \n   - **Direct Evidence**: Doc2 states, \"the UK voted to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum,\" which created the context for Scotland and Northern Ireland’s remain votes to be highlighted as dissenting outcomes.  \n   - **Confidence**: 🟢 HIGH. The UK-wide result (Leave) is the causal backdrop for analyzing regional remain votes.  \n\n4. **Option C (Cameron’s renegotiation failed):**  \n   - **Indirect Role**: Doc4 mentions Cameron’s failed renegotiation, but this primarily fueled the Leave campaign rather than directly causing Scotland/NI’s remain votes.  \n   - **Confidence**: 🔴 LOW. No direct link to regional voting patterns.  \n\n**Conclusion**: A, B, and D are directly supported by evidence and necessary for explaining the target event.
