This meets **temporal precedence** (earnings report precedes stock surge) and **causal mechanism** (positive financial results → investor confidence → market cap spike).  \n- **Option B**: While Doc5 confirms Nvidia’s 1993 founding, this is **background context**, not a direct cause of the $1T valuation event.  \n- **Option C**: No evidence in any document. Irrelevant to Nvidia’s market cap surge.  \n- **Option D**: Doc5 confirms the 1999 IPO, but this is **historical** and unrelated to the immediate 2025 financial results driving the valuation.  \n\n**Critical Compliance**: Strictly avoided over-selection (B/D are non-causal historical facts; C is irrelevant).

Temporal precedence and causal mechanism align.  \n- **Option B**: Tarana Burke’s 2006 \"Me Too\" laid groundwork but wasn’t the **direct** trigger for the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet emerged from the 2017 viral #MeToo wave (Doc9 clarifies Milano’s tweet, not Burke’s org, drove the 2017 resurgence).  \n- **Option C**: No evidence in docs.  \n- **Option D**: Nestor’s 2014 incident (Doc3/Doc4) exemplifies harassment but isn’t a **direct** cause of the spreadsheet’s creation.  \n\n**Critical Checks**:  \n- A satisfies temporal order + causal pathway (exposure → collective action).  \n- B is foundational but indirect.

Strength: **Strong** but temporally distant.  \n- **B**: Explicitly documented in Doc5 (NYT Weinstein exposé on Oct 5, 2017). Strength: **Strong**.  \n- **C**: Mentioned in Doc5 (Nestor’s 2014 interaction) but no causal link to 2017 virality. Strength: **None**.  \n- **D**: Doc5 notes 1972 rape crisis center. Strength: **None** (historical context, not causal).  \n\n**PHASE 2: Causal Verification**  \n1. **Temporal**:  \n   - B (Oct 5, 2017) precedes target event (Oct 2017). ✅  \n   - A (2006) precedes but lacks direct temporal proximity. ❌  \n2. **Mechanism**:  \n   - B directly triggered public outrage, enabling Milano’s viral hashtag (Doc5: Weinstein revelations \"opened the floodgates\"). ✅  \n   - A provided the phrase \"Me Too\" but did not directly cause the 2017 virality. ❌  \n3. **Direction**:  \n   - B is a **cause** (Weinstein scandal → #MeToo momentum). ✅  \n   - A is background, not a proximate cause. ❌  \n\n**PHASE 3: Risk-Adjusted Selection**  \n- **B**: Clear causation + strong evidence → **SELECT**.  \n- A/C/D: Rejected (A is foundational but not direct; C/D irrelevant).  \n\n**PHASE 4: Consistency Checks**  \n- No duplicates. B is the sole direct cause.  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A,B\n",

Replacing Inpe’s director was a critical act of institutional sabotage, eroding trust in Brazil’s commitment to forest protection.  \n- **Other Options**:  \n  - A/B (fires) & C (MAAP report) describe environmental consequences, not direct policy triggers.  \n  - Funds were withheld due to governance/policy failures (Bolsonaro’s actions), not fires/deforestation itself.  \n\n**Critical Warnings Heeded**:  \n- Avoided over-selecting correlated events (fires/deforestation).  \n- Focused on DIRECT institutional/policy actions (D) as the proximate cause for fund suspension.  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: D\n",

Document 3 and 9 explicitly link Ghani's flight to the collapse of government authority, enabling Taliban fighters to seize police vehicles/Humvees and spread across Kabul. Temporal proximity and causation are clear.  \n- **Option D (2020 Trump-Taliban deal)** is a root cause but *not* a direct cause of the specific August 15 event. While the agreement enabled the withdrawal and Taliban resurgence, it operates through a longer causal chain and does not directly explain the immediate takeover of Kabul streets.  \n- **Option B (2001 bombing)** and **A (none correct)** are invalid. B is temporally disconnected (~20 years prior), and C is valid.  \n\n**Key Risks Avoided:**  \n- Over-selection (D is tempting but indirect per causal chain rules).  \n- Strict adherence to direct causation framework (C = immediate trigger, D = enabling condition).\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: C\n",
