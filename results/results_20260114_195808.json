Yes**.  \n\n- **B/C**: \"Signature Bank failed after a bank run\"  \n  - Doc1: \"Signature Bank (which also failed Friday after a bank run).\"  \n  - Doc9: \"Signature Bank failed after a bank run.\"  \n  - **Found? Yes** (for B; C is a duplicate).  \n\n- **D**: \"SVB suspended trading of its shares on Friday\"  \n  - Doc1: \"halted trading on its plummeting stock.\"  \n  - Doc4: \"SVB suspended trading of its shares.\"  \n  - **Found? Yes**.  \n\n**STEP 2: Causation Test**  \n- **A**:  \n  1. **Before? Yes** (withdrawals preceded regulatory action).  \n  2. **Direct Cause? Yes** (bank run directly triggered SVB’s collapse, forcing regulators to act).  \n  3. **Not a consequence/correlated** (root cause of SVB’s failure).  \n\n- **B**:  \n  1. **Before? Yes** (Signature failed concurrently with SVB).  \n  2. **Direct Cause? Yes** (regulators announced coverage for **both** banks; Signature’s failure necessitated inclusion).  \n  3. **Not a consequence/correlated** (parallel event requiring joint action).  \n\n- **D**:  \n  1. **Before? Yes** (trading halted Friday).  \n  2. **Direct Cause? No** (trading suspension was a **consequence** of panic, not cause of the deposit guarantee).  \n  3. **Consequence** (of withdrawals/bank run).  \n\n**STEP 3: Final Selection**  \n- **A** and **B** directly caused the deposit guarantee.  \n- **C** is redundant (identical to B).  \n- **D** is excluded (consequence, not cause).  \n\n**CRITICAL RULES APPLIED**:  \n- Avoid over-selection (B/C duplication ignored).  \n- D excluded despite evidence (not a direct cause).  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A,B,C\n",
