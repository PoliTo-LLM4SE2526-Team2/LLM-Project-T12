Detentions occurred **BEFORE** the announcement (Doc1: raids → TV address).  \n  2. **NOT DIRECT CAUSE**: Detentions are **part of the coup execution**, not its root cause. The military’s stated justification was election fraud (Doc1: \"alleged election irregularities,\" Doc5: \"citing fraud\").  \n  3. **Consequence/Component**: Detentions are a tactical step *within* the coup, not a causal antecedent.  \n\n**STEP 3: Final Selection**  \n- All options (A/B/D) describe **actions integral to the coup itself**, not direct causes.  \n- **C** lacks documentary evidence.  \n- True cause (election fraud disputes) is **not listed** as an option.  \n\n**CRITICAL RULES APPLIED**:  \n- Over-selection risk: Avoiding incorrect attribution of coup *components* as causes.  \n- \"None correct\" applies: No option reflects the documented root cause (electoral disputes).  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A,B,D\n",

Doc1 explicitly states: \"Nvidia released its first quarter earnings report [...] estimating $11 billion in sales for the second quarter [...] and reporting earnings per share of $1.09.\"  \n- **B**: NO. While Docs 1-2 mention \"surging demand\" for AI chips, there is **no explicit evidence** of a \"shortage\" caused by industry focus.  \n- **C**: NO. Doc1 confirms Nvidia’s founding in 1993, but this is **historical background**, not a direct cause of the 2025 supply increase.  \n- **D**: NO. Document 6 discusses AMD/Nvidia competition, but **no documents mention South Korean stock purchases** related to Nvidia’s supply decision.  \n\n**STEP 2: Causation Test**  \n- **A**:  \n  1. **Before**: YES (earnings report preceded the announcement).  \n  2. **Direct Cause**: YES. The report explicitly triggered the decision: \"Huang said the company is 'significantly increasing' supply to meet 'surging demand' **after** the earnings release\" (Doc1).  \n  3. **Not consequence/correlated**: Direct cause (earnings revealed demand, prompting supply action).  \n\n**STEP 3: Final Selection**  \nOnly **A** meets all criteria. Options B-D lack evidence or fail causation tests.  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A\n",

Hunt reversed policies *because of the mini-budget’s market chaos*, not solely due to Kwarteng’s dismissal.  \n- **C**: Queen’s death (Sept 8) paused government activity but **no causal link** to economic policy reversal.  \n- **D**: Mini-budget (Sept 23) directly caused **financial panic** (Doc1: \"sent financial markets into chaos\"; Doc4: \"rocked financial markets\").

Doc6 confirms Muhandis was killed alongside Soleimani when he picked him up from Baghdad airport.  \n   - **Causation**:  \n     - **Before?** Yes (January 3 strike → January 5 parliamentary vote).  \n     - **Direct Cause?** Yes. Doc1 and Doc4 directly link the strike to Iraq’s sovereignty violation claims, prompting the expulsion vote.  \n     - **Nature**: Direct cause (immediate trigger).  \n\n2. **Option B**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Doc6 notes Muhandis founded Kataib Hezbollah in 2006.  \n   - **Causation**:  \n     - Historical background, not a proximate cause. No direct link to the 2020 vote.  \n\n3. **Option C**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Doc7 mentions Iran suspending nuclear compliance post-strike.  \n   - **Causation**:  \n     - **After?** Yes (announced after the parliamentary vote).  \n     - Consequence, not a cause.  \n\n4. **Option D**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Doc1 confirms Trump ordered Soleimani’s assassination.  \n   - **Causation**:  \n     - **Before?** Yes (order precedes strike).  \n     - **Direct Cause?** No. The *execution* (drone strike) is the direct cause; the order is a prior step.  \n     - **Nature**: Indirect (order → strike → vote). Over-selecting D would conflate intent with action.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Only **A** meets strict criteria (direct evidence, temporal precedence, causal link). Selecting D risks over-inclusion, as the strike itself—not the order—was the immediate trigger.  \n\nFinal Answer: **A**"
