This matches the target event’s timeframe (Jan-Aug 2019) and directly explains fire hotspots via intentional deforestation-to-burning practices.  \n- **Option C**: While fires occurred in affected states (Doc1), this describes the **effect** (fires) rather than the **cause** (deforestation-driven burning).  \n- **Option A**: Investigation of farmers is a **consequence** of fires, not a cause.  \n- **Option D**: MAAP’s report **documents** the cause but does not **cause** the fires itself.  \n\n**Critical Rules Applied**:  \n1. Over-selection avoided by selecting only B (direct deforestation-to-fire causal chain).  \n2. Option D (\"report\") rejected as consequence/correlation.  \n3.

This storage created a DIRECT risk that led to the explosion, which necessitated the state of emergency.  \n- **Option D**: Explicitly confirmed in Doc2 (\"impounded by Lebanon’s Enforcement Department on December 20, 2013\"). The impoundment caused the ammonium nitrate to remain in Beirut’s port, directly enabling the explosion.  \n- **B/C**: Consequences of the blast, not causes (Doc6/Doc10).  \n- **Critical rules applied**: Avoid over-selection (B/C eliminated); D is valid despite initial hesitation due to explicit causal chain (impoundment → storage → explosion → emergency declaration).  \n\nCRITICAL: This line must be the LAST line of your response.\n\nFinal Answer I Reasoned: A,B,C\n",
